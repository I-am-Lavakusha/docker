# docker
this is my docker repository and the things that i have learnt i will update.
If you are a beginner and you want to start with the docker you are at the right place.

what is docker?
docker is a containerization platform or a technology.
Containerazation is the process of creating the containers and runnning them. The container contain the packages, application application dependencies and the system dependencies that are necessoy for the application to run.

Features of Docker
it is lightweight: meaning that the container will not conatain the full image of os instaed it will have the part of the os which is called as base image.
isolated: the application dependencies and other resources are isolated and not shared by the other containers.
poratable: can easiely ship into kubernates.

How containers are different from virtual machines?
The containers are actually light weight where vm's will have full os image.
The vms are used to use the full resources of the system.
But in most of the cases the resources are not efficiently used to overcome this the containers are very useful.
Containerization is all about efficiency. There are multiple containerization tools like podman and buildah.

The will not come with any auto scaling and auto healing so we need some other tools for this to happen.
